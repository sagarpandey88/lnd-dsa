/**
 * Recurrsions
 * 1. Identify the base case .i.e condition which will break recurrsion
 * 2. Indentify the recursive case
 * 3. Return the output from the function
 *
 * If you dont know how deep the data structure is then use recurrsion
 * using a tree or converting to a tree
 * If problem can be broken into sub problem
 *
 * PLUS:
 * Readable
 *
 * CONS:
 * uses large stacks
